Please note this is my first Kotlin code and I may have been wriging Java in Kotlin,
I would like to say I did not understand what a limit order was. 
I have thus googled and found this definition `A limit order in the financial markets is a direction to purchase or sell 
a stock or other security at a specified price or better`
I then made up the data structure to make it the similar to the order book one
I have used Spek and JUnit to write unit tests


run the project using `mvn clean  spring-boot:run` then go to http://localhost:8080
username is user, password is password for protected resources
you may login @ http://localhost:8080/login
run unit tests using `mvn clean test`
